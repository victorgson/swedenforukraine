For Ukrainians is authored by Victor Gustafsson as a final project at IT-Högskolan in Gothenburg. The app wouldn't been possible without help from Yuliia Kyzyk.
As a Swedish citizen, we often take for granted all the instituions a refugee, immigrant or asylum seeker has to go through. This was something that my girlfriend Yuliia shined a light on, and when I got the opportunity to develop an app as a final project before my graduation I knew what to do.
 The app gathers all the most useful links that can be helpful in one place.
